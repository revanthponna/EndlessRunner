* Click [here](https://revanthponna.github.io/EndlessRunner/) to play the game on a Github page created for this game.
* A 3D endless runner game I developed in Unity with coins and obstacles spawning at random points.
* Developed a point system and high score count, as well as animations for player jump and run.
* Programmed the spawning of ground tiles such that there is minimal wastage of memory.
